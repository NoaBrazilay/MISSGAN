We discuss how the Gibbs sampler can be used for model order selection by estimating the marginal likelihood, and compare with the Bayesian information criterion. For computing the maximum a posteriori estimate we present an iterated conditional modes algorithm that rivals existing state-of-the-art NMF algorithms on an image feature extraction problem. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract = {Weighted Median (WM) filters have attracted a growing number of interest in the past few years. They inherent the robustness and edge preserving capability of the classical median filter and resemble linear FIR filters in certain properties. Furthermore, WM filters belong to the broad class of nonlinear filters called stack filters. This enables the use of the tools developed for the latter class in characterizing and analyzing the behavior and properties of WM filters, e.g. noise attenuation capability. The fact that WM filters are threshold functions allows the use of neural network training methods to obtain adaptive W M filters. In this tutorial paper we trace the development of the theory of WM filtering from its beginnings in the median filter to the recently developed theory of optimal weighted median filtering. The following one and multidimensional applications are presented in this paper: idempotent weighted median filters for speech processing, adaptive weighted median and optimal weighted median filters for image and image sequence restoration , weighted medians as robust predictors in DPCM coding and Quincunx coding, and weighted median filters in scan rate conversion in normal TV and HDTV systems.},

In this paper, we construct a new hierarchical Bayesian generative model for the L 1-norm LRMF problem and design a mean-field variational method to automatically infer all the parameters involved in the model by closed-form equations. The variational Bayesian inference in the proposed method can be understood as solving a weighted LRMF problem with different weights on matrix elements based on their significance and with L 2-regularization penalties on parameters. Throughout the inference process of our method, the weights imposed on the matrix elements can be adaptively fitted so that the adverse influence of noises and outliers embedded in data can be largely suppressed, and the parameters can be appropriately regularized so that the generalization capability of the problem can be statistically guaranteed. The robustness and the efficiency of the proposed method are substantiated by a series of synthetic and real data experiments, as compared with the state-of-the-art L 1-norm LRMF methods. Especially, attributed to the intrinsic generalization capability of the Bayesian methodology, our method can always predict better on the unobserved ground truth data than existing methods.},

abstract = {We present a generative appearance-based method for recognizing human faces under variation in lighting and viewpoint. Our method exploits the fact that the set of images of an object in fixed pose, but under all possible illumination conditions, is a convex cone in the space of images. Using a small number of training images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo of the face can be reconstructed. In turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative model that can be used to render-or synthesize-images of the face under novel poses and illumination conditions. The pose space is then sampled, and for each pose the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. Our recognition algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination cone (based on Euclidean distance within the image space). We test our face recognition method on 4050 images from the Yale Face Database B; these images contain 405 viewing conditions (9 poses ¢ 45 illumination conditions) for 10 individuals. The method performs almost without error, except on the most extreme lighting directions, and significantly outperforms popular recognition methods that do not use a generative model.},

@article{Retno2017,
abstract = {In general, the parameter estimation of GWOLR model uses maximum likelihood method, but it constructs a system of nonlinear equations, making it difficult to find the solution. Therefore, an approximate solution is needed. There are two popular numerical methods: the methods of Newton and Quasi-Newton (QN). Newton's method requires large-scale time in executing the computation program since it contains Jacobian matrix (derivative). QN method overcomes the drawback of Newton's method by substituting derivative computation into a function of direct computation. The QN method uses Hessian matrix approach which contains Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) formula. The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method is categorized as the QN method which has the DFP formula attribute of having positive definite Hessian matrix. The BFGS method requires large memory in executing the program so another algorithm to decrease memory usage is needed, namely Low Memory BFGS (LBFGS). The purpose of this research is to compute the efficiency of the LBFGS method in the iterative and recursive computation of Hessian matrix and its inverse for the GWOLR parameter estimation. In reference to the research findings, we found out that the BFGS and LBFGS methods have arithmetic operation schemes, including O(n2) and O(nm).},

At each iteration, the algorithms require inexact evaluations of the proximal operator, as well as, approximate subgradients of the functions (namely: theϵ-subgradients). The methods use different error criteria for approximating the proximal operators. We provide an analysis of the convergence and rate of convergence properties of these methods, considering various stepsize rules, including both, diminishing and constant stepsizes. For the case where one of the functions is smooth, we propose an inexact accelerated version of the proximal gradient method, and prove that the optimal convergence rate for the function values can be achieved. Moreover, we provide some numerical experiments comparing our algorithm with similar recent ones.},

The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element‐by‐element) by $\sigma$ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non‐negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non‐negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non‐negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.

abstract = {In this paper we study smooth convex programming problems where the decision variables vector is split into several blocks of variables. We analyze the block coordinate gradient projection method in which each iteration consists of performing a gradient projection step with respect to a certain block taken in a cyclic order. Global sublinear rate of convergence of this method is established and it is shown that it can be accelerated when the problem is unconstrained. In the unconstrained setting we also prove a sublinear rate of convergence result for the so-called alternating minimization method when the number of blocks is two. When the objective function is also assumed to be strongly convex, linear rate of convergence is established. 1. Introduction. One of the first variable decomposition methods for solving general minimization problems is the so-called alternating minimization method [5, 14], which is based on successive global minimization with respect to each component vector in a cyclic order. This fundamental method appears in the literature under various names such as the block-nonlinear Gauss-Seidel method or the block coordinate descent method (see, e.g., [4]). The convergence of the method was extensively studied in the literature under various assumptions. For example, Auslender studied in [1] the convergence of the method under a strong convexity assumption , but without assuming differentiability. In [4] Bertsekas showed that if the minimum with respect to each block of variables is unique, then any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the method is also a stationary point. Grippo and Sciandrone showed in [7] convergence results of the sequence generated by the method under different sets of assumptions such as strict quasi convexity with respect to each block. Luo and Tseng proved in [9] that under the assumptions of strong convexity with respect to each block, existence of a local error bound of the objective function , and proper separation of isocost surfaces, linear rate of convergence can be established. Another closely related method, which will be the main focus of this paper, is the block coordinate gradient projection (BCGP) method in which at each subiteration, the exact minimization with respect to a certain block of variables is replaced with an employment of a single step of the gradient projection method (a step toward the gradient followed by an orthogonal projection). This method has a clear advantage over alternating minimization when exact minimization with respect to each of the},

Assuming that f is continuous on a compact level set, the subsequence convergence of the iterates to a stationary point is shown when either f is pseudoconvex in every pair of coordinate blocks from among N - 1 coordinate blocks or f has at most one minimum in each of N - 2 coordinate blocks. If f is quasiconvex and hemivariate in every coordinate block, then the assumptions of continuity of f and compactness of the level set may be relaxed further. These results are applied to derive new (and old) convergence results for the proximal minimization algorithm, an algorithm of Arimoto and Blahut, and an algorithm of Han. They are applied also to a problem of blind source separation.},

abstract = {A challenging problem in machine learning, information retrieval and computer vision research is how to recover a low-rank representation of the given data in the presence of outliers and missing entries. The L1-norm low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) has been a popular approach to solving this problem. However, L1-norm LRMF is difficult to achieve due to its non-convexity and non-smoothness, and existing methods are often inefficient and fail to converge to a desired solution. In this paper we propose a novel cyclic weighted median (CWM) method, which is intrinsically a coordinate decent algorithm, for L1-norm LRMF. The CWM method minimizes the objective by solving a sequence of scalar minimization sub-problems, each of which is convex and can be easily solved by the weighted median filter. The extensive experimental results validate that the CWM method outperforms state-of-the-arts in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) is a powerful tool for the accurate and effective diagnosis and treatment of a variety of conditions because it allows high-resolution three-dimensional images to be acquired very quickly. However as the number of CT procedures performed globally have continued to increase; with growing concerns about patient protection. Currently, no system is in place to track patient doses and the lifetime cumulative dose from medical sources. The widespread use of CT even in developing countries has raised questions regarding the possible threat to public health especially in children. The best available risk estimates suggest that paediatric CT will result in significantly increased lifetime radiation risk over adult CT. Studies have shown that lower milliampere-second (mAs) settings can be used for children without significant loss of information. Although the risk-benefit balance is still strongly tilted toward benefit, there is still need for caution. Furthermore since the frequency of paediatric CT examinations is rapidly increasing, and estimates suggest that quantitative lifetime radiation risks for children are not negligible, efforts should be made toward more active reduction of CT exposure settings in paediatric patients. This article hopes to address this concerns and draw attention to the fact that children are not 'small adults ' and should therefore be treated differently.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the cancer risk in children and adolescents following exposure to low dose ionising radiation from diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans. Design: Population based, cohort, data linkage study in Australia. Cohort members: 10.9 million people identified from Australian Medicare records, aged 0-19 years on 1 January 1985 or born between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2005; all exposures to CT scans funded by Medicare during 1985-2005 were identified for this cohort. Cancers diagnosed in cohort members up to 31 December 2007 were obtained through linkage to national cancer records. Main outcome: Cancer incidence rates in individuals exposed to a CT scan more than one year before any cancer diagnosis, compared with cancer incidence rates in unexposed individuals. Results: 60 674 cancers were recorded, including 3150 in 680 211 people exposed to a CT scan at least one year before any cancer diagnosis. The mean duration of follow-up after exposure was 9.5 years. Overall cancer incidence was 24{\%} greater for exposed than for unexposed people, after accounting for age, sex, and year of birth (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.24 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.20 to 1.29); P{\textless}0.001). We saw a dose-response relation, and the IRR increased by 0.16 (0.13 to 0.19) for each additional CT scan. The IRR was greater after exposure at younger ages (P{\textless}0.001 for trend). At 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15 or more years since first exposure, IRRs were 1.35 (1.25 to 1.45), 1.25 (1.17 to 1.34), 1.14 (1.06 to 1.22), and 1.24 (1.14 to 1.34), respectively. The IRR increased significantly for many types of solid cancer (digestive organs, melanoma, soft tissue, female genital, urinary tract, brain, and thyroid); leukaemia, myelodysplasia, and some other lymphoid cancers. There was an excess of 608 cancers in people exposed to CT scans (147 brain, 356 other solid, 48 leukaemia or myelodysplasia, and 57 other lymphoid). The absolute excess incidence rate for all cancers combined was 9.38 per 100 000 person years at risk, as of 31 December 2007. The average effective radiation dose per scan was estimated as 4.5 mSv. Conclusions: The increased incidence of cancer after CT scan exposure in this cohort was mostly due to irradiation. Because the cancer excess was still continuing at the end of follow-up, the eventual lifetime risk from CT scans cannot yet be determined. Radiation doses from contemporary CT scans are likely to be lower than those in 1985-2005, but some increase in cancer risk is still likely from current scans. Future CT scans should be limited to situations where there is a definite clinical indication, with every scan optimised to provide a diagnostic CT image at the lowest possible radiation dose.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. In the last decade, the technological progress of multi-slice CT imaging has turned CCTA into a valuable tool for coronary assessment in many low to medium risk patients. Nevertheless, CCTA protocols expose the patient to high radiation doses, imposed by image quality and multiple cardiac phase acquisition requirements. Widespread use of CCTA calls for significant reduction of radiation exposure while maintaining high image quality as required for coronary assessment. Denoising algorithms have been recently applied to low-dose CT scans after image reconstruction. In this work, a fast neural regression framework is proposed for the denoising of low-dose CCTA. For this purpose, regression networks are trained to synthesize high-SNR patches directly from low-SNR input patches. In contrast to published methods, the denoising network is trained on real noise directly learned from noisy CT data rather than assuming a known parametric noise model. The denoised value for each pixel is computed as a function of the synthesized patches overlapping the pixel. The proposed algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art published algorithms for synthetic and real noise. The feature similarity index (FSIM) achieved by the proposed method is superior in all the comparisons with other methods, for synthetic radiation dose reductions higher than 90{\%}. The results are further supported qualitatively, by observing a significant improvement in subsequent coronary reconstruction performed by commercial software on denoised images. The fast and high quality denoising capability suggests the proposed algorithm as a promising method for low-dose CCTA denoising.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, CARS. Purpose: Low-dose CT screening of the lungs is becoming a reality, triggering many more CT-guided lung biopsies. During these biopsies, the patient is submitted to repeated guiding scans with substantial cumulated radiation dose. Extension of the dose reduction to the biopsy procedure is therefore necessary. We propose an image denoising algorithm that specifically addresses the setup of CT-guided lung biopsies. It minimizes radiation exposure while keeping the image quality appropriate for navigation to the target lesion. Methods : A database of high-SNR CT patches is used to filter noisy pixels in a non-local means framework, while explicitly enforcing local spatial consistency in order to preserve fine image details and structures. The patch database may be created from a multi-patient set of high-SNR lung scans. Alternatively, the first scan, acquired at high-SNR right before the needle insertion, can provide a convenient patient-specific patch database. Results : The proposed algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art denoising algorithms for a dataset of 43 real CT-guided biopsy scans. Ultra-low-dose scans were simulated by synthetic noise addition to the sinogram, equivalent to a 96{\%} reduction in radiation dose. The feature similarity score for the proposed algorithm outperformed the compared methods for all the scans in the dataset. The benefit of the patient-specific patch database over the multi-patient one is demonstrated in terms of recovered contrast for a tiny porcine lung nodule, following denoising with both approaches. Conclusions : The proposed method provides a promising approach to the denoising of ultra-low-dose CT-guided biopsy images.},

@article{Green2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 CCTA has become an important tool for coronary arteries assessment in low and medium risk patients. However, it exposes the patient to significant radiation doses, resulting from high image quality requirements and acquisitions at multiple cardiac phases. For widespread use of CCTA for coronary assessment, significant reduction of radiation exposure with minimal image quality loss is still needed. A neural denoising scheme, relying on a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) architecture, is developed and applied to noisy CCTA. In contrast to previously published methods, the proposed FCNN is trained directly on 3-D CT data patches (blocks), implementing 3-D convolutions. Considering that anatomy is inherently tridimensional, the proposed 3-D approach may better capture and enforce inter-slice continuity of tiny structures. While training is performed on individual blocks, whole input scans can be fed and denoised in one piece, thus leveraging the fully convolutional architecture to maximize processing speed. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art denoising algorithms on a dataset of 45 CCTA scans. Low-dose scans are simulated by synthetic Poisson noise applied to the sinogram corresponding to a 90{\%} reduction in radiation dose. The average feature similarity score (0.864) and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (41.47) obtained for the proposed algorithm outperformed the compared methods while requiring significantly shorter processing time. A set of 2-D FCNNs, structurally similar to the proposed 3-D network, are also implemented to demonstrate contribution of the additional dimension to the improved denoising. For further validation of the method coronary reconstruction using the Intellispace cardiac tool (Philips, Holland) is performed both on a real noisy CCTA scan and on the denoised scan using the proposed method. It is shown that the cardiac tool succeeds in reconstructing more coronaries using the scan denoised by the proposed method. The obtained results suggest the proposed method provides an efficient and powerful approach to low-dose CCTA denoising.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016. The never-ending quest for lower radiation exposure is a major challenge to the image quality of advanced CT scans. Post-processing algorithms have been recently proposed to improve low-dose CT denoising after image reconstruction. In this work,a novel algorithm,termed the locally-consistent non-local means (LC-NLM),is proposed for this challenging task. By using a database of high-SNR CT patches to filter noisy pixels while locally enforcing spatial consistency,the proposed algorithm achieves both powerful denoising and preservation of fine image details. The LC-NLM is compared both quantitatively and qualitatively,for synthetic and real noise,to state-of-the-art published algorithms. The highest structural similarity index (SSIM) were achieved by LC-NLM in 8 out of 10 denoised chest CT volumes. Also,the visual appearance of the denoised images was clearly better for the proposed algorithm. The favorable comparison results,together with the computational efficiency of LC-NLM makes it a promising tool for low-dose CT denoising.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018. Neural image denoising is a promising approach for quality enhancement of ultra-low dose (ULD) CT scans after image reconstruction. The availability of high-quality training data is instrumental to its success. Still, synthetic noise is generally used to simulate the ULD scans required for network training in conjunction with corresponding normal dose scans. This reductive approach may be practical to implement but ignores any departure of the real noise from the assumed model. In this paper, we demonstrate the training of denoising neural networks with real noise. For this purpose, a special training set is created from a pair of ULD and normal-dose scans acquired on each subject. Accurate deformable registration is computed to ensure the required pixel-wise overlay between corresponding ULD and normal-dose patches. To our knowledge, it is the first time real CT noise is used for the training of denoising neural networks. The benefits of the proposed approach in comparison to synthetic noise training are demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively for several state-of-the art denoising neural networks. The obtained results prove the feasibility and applicability of real noise learning as a way to improve neural denoising of ULD lung CT.},
